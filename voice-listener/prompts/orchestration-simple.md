EXECUTION MODE: Direct
Work on this task directly. Use TodoWrite to track your progress on multi-step work. Keep it focused — one problem, one solution.

If you discover this is more complex than expected (e.g., requires parallel workstreams, multi-phase coordination, or affects multiple systems), use the Task tool to spawn sub-agents for isolated pieces of work.
